And where sleeves used to flow rather freely, stiff but round bell-shaped sleeves would appear, pleated just below the shoulders, contrasting the pañuelo’s sharp appearance.12 The starching was most likely a result of the use of textiles other than the usual abaca, which was naturally stiff.[How the Terno Took Shape]",How the Terno Took Shape,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg

Despite this change, pañuelos were still used on wedding ternos to convey a sense of the bride’s purity. And by the 1950s, the terno would be widely known as a dress with a low neckline and flat, rigid butterfly sleeves.
